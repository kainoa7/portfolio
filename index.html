										<h2><a href="#">Serverless App with<br />
										AWS Lambda</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="chat-app.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Built a chat application entirely with AWS services, and no stand-alone servers at all.
										Architected and designed serverless applications. Served static resources to browsers using AWS's S3 (Simple Storage Service). Used Javascript to dynamically modify web pages as well as managed permissions and access policies using IAM which means Identity and Access Management. I was able to manipulate and vend data in the cloud using AWS Lambda. Then, I used CORS to manage client-side security in serverless apps
										Store and retrieve data with DynamoDB. 
										I modeled API's and created SDK's with API Gateway. Created a user login system with Cognito. 
										I was able to speed up my web app with a CloudFront CDN.

										<h2><a href="#">AWS WEB Application<br />
											with Amplify</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="math-function.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Developed a math web application on AWS, utilizing services like Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, 
										and DynamoDB. Crafted the initial web page structure, deployed it with AWS Amplify for web accessibility, 
										and implemented math functionality through a Python Lambda function. Established seamless front-end to back-end
										 communication via a REST API using API Gateway, ensuring data persistence in DynamoDB. Enhanced the client-side 
										 experience by invoking the API Gateway endpoint from the Amplify-hosted index.html page. Implemented continuous 
										 improvement with AWS Amplify for immediate updates on the hosted web page, showcasing the application's computational capabilities and efficient storage. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">File Processing:<br />
										JSON to CSV</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="file-processing.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Developed a C++ program for file processing with the goal of reading a "people file" in JSON format and writing
										 it out to a file in CSV format. The program also determines and displays the minimum, maximum, and average ages 
										 of the people in the file. Utilized JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for representing attribute-value pairs 
										 related to individuals, including first name, last name, age, height, and nationality. The program reads JSON-formatted 
										 input, converts it to CSV, and produces a CSV file. Additionally, the program handles special cases, such as blank 
										 lines or files that cannot be opened for reading, providing error messages and restarting the loop when necessary. 
										 Good programming practices were followed, including appropriate comments, indentation, meaningful variable names, and 
										 adherence to identifiers convention. The code successfully passed unit tests, validated file existence and format, 
										 calculated age statistics, and demonstrated robust file processing with the ability to handle various scenarios as specified in the assignment.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Tinder Website<br />
										for Dogs: TinDog</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="TinDog.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Designed a vibrant and user-friendly front-end for a whimsical Tinder-inspired website for dogs called TinDog. The index.html features a gradient background and utilizes Bootstrap for responsiveness. The title section introduces the site with a catchy tagline and prompts users to download the app for Apple and Google devices.
										The features section highlights key attributes, creatively represented with icons, emphasizing TinDog's ease of use, elite clientele, and a guarantee of success in finding the perfect match for dogs.
										The testimonial section adds authenticity with a quote from a satisfied user named Pebbles, accompanied by an adorable dog image. Logos from renowned publications enhance TinDog's credibility.
										The pricing section presents three plans for dogs â€“ Chihuahua, Labrador, and Mastiff, each with varying features and pricing. Users can sign up for free or choose premium plans.
										The footer provides essential links, and copyright information adds a professional touch. In summary, TinDog is a visually appealing and engaging platform, offering a delightful experience for dog owners seeking companionship for their furry friends.
